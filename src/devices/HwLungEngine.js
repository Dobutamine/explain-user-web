// This is a dedicated web worker instance for the physiological model engine API
// Web workers run in a separate thread for performance reasons and have no access to the DOM nor the window object
// The scope is defined by self and communication with the main thread by a message channel
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Workers_API/Using_web_workers#web_workers_api

// Communication with the script which spawned the web worker takes place through a communication channel
// Messages are received in the onmessage event and are sent by the _send function

// Explain request object :
/* {
  type:       <string> stating the type of message (REST (PUT/POST/GET/DELETE/PATCH))
  message:    <string> stating the component of the model for which the message is intended (p.e. 'datalogger'/'interventions')
  payload:    <object> containing data to pass to the action
}
